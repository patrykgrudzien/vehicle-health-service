* **_OAuth2 & OpenID Connect (Spring Security & Vue.js)_**
    * **_STEP 1_**
        * User presses a "Social Sign On" button -> "{baseUrl}/oauth2/authorization/google"
    * **_STEP 2 - Spring Security Intercepts the Above Request_**
        * Spring Security has a [OAuth2AuthorizationRequestRedirectFilter](), which intercepts requests of the pattern /oauth2/authorization/* and does the following:
            * Creates an  [OAuth2AuthorizationRequest]() object
            * Stores that using a configured [AuthorizationRequestRepository]()
            * Redirects the browser to the provider's [authorization-uri]() page (e.g. https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth), with a few parameters. Among the parameters would be a callback URL (e.g. https://api.example.com/login/oauth2/code/google)
    * **_STEP 3 - User Logs in to the Provider and Approves Our Application_**
        * 
    * **_STEP 4 - Spring Security Intercepts the Above Request_**<br>
        In the backend, Spring's [OAuth2LoginAuthenticationFilter]() intercepts the above request (e.g. https://api.example.com/login/oauth2/code/google), and:
        * Receives the parameters, e.g. <b>accessToken</b> and <b>state</b>.
        * Retrieves the [OAuth2AuthorizationRequest]() saved earlier, using the configured AuthorizationRequestRepository discussed earlier, and does things like matching the state.
        * Calls a configured [OAuth2UserService]() implementation to retrieve the user information (email etc.) by calling the user-info-uri of the provider (e.g. https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo).
        * Authenticates the user.
        * Clears the stored [OAuth2AuthorizationRequest]().
        * Redirects the user to a configured <b>success-url</b>. You may be thinking that you could configure the success-url to be the homepage of your front-end, but that wonâ€™t work with a stateless backend.
